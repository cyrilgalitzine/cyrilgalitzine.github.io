<p>I am a computational biologist with a background in Aerospace Engineering.
	I received my PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the <a href="http://ngpdlab.engin.umich.edu" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> where I worked on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_simulation_Monte_Carlo" target="_blank">Monte Carlo</a> simulation of high speed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry" target="_blank">reentry</a> flows.  I am currently a Postdoc at <a href="https://olga-vitek-lab.ccis.northeastern.edu" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a> where I am working on Bayesian learning and inference in Computational Systems Biology. I am particularly interested in stochastic biological systems.
	A list of all my publications is available <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lBbQpBAAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>. I enjoy writing code in C++, R and Python some of which can be available on <a href="https://github.com/cyrilgalitzine" target="_blank">github</a>.
